# PixCII üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: BugBusters

### Project Description

PixcII is a C++ / OpenCV project that transforms video frames into **animated, colored ASCII art** and plays them directly in your terminal ‚Äî combining retro aesthetics with real-time performance.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Imagine this: you‚Äôve just installed a brand-new copy of any OS.
It‚Äôs shiny. It‚Äôs clean. It has‚Ä¶ absolutely no media players installed.
You double-click your favorite video ‚ÄîOS stares back at you, helpless.

Installing VLC? Takes too long.
Opening a browser to stream it? Ugh, that‚Äôs work.
What if‚Ä¶ you could watch the video instantly, right in your terminal?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Enter PixcII ‚Äî the world‚Äôs most unnecessary yet oddly satisfying answer.
All you need is a terminal, a C++ compiler, and OpenCV.
No clunky video players, no bloated UI ‚Äî just pure ASCII characters rendering your video in real time, colors included.

Because when life gives you pixels, turn them into text.
