# PixCII 🎯

### Project Description

PixcII is a C++ / OpenCV project that transforms video frames into **animated, colored ASCII art** and plays them directly in your terminal — combining retro aesthetics with real-time performance.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

⚠️Imagine this: you’ve just installed a brand-new copy of any OS.
It’s shiny. It’s clean. It has… absolutely no media players installed.
You double-click your favorite video —OS stares back at you, helpless.

Installing VLC? Takes too long.
Opening a browser to stream it? Ugh, that’s work.
What if… you could watch the video instantly, right in your terminal?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

💡 Enter PixcII — the world’s most unnecessary yet oddly satisfying answer.
All you need is a terminal, a C++ compiler, and OpenCV.
No clunky video players, no bloated UI — just pure ASCII characters rendering your video in real time, colors included.

Because when life gives you pixels, turn them into text.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- **Languages used:**  
  ✅ C++
- **Frameworks used:**  
  ✅ None (pure C++)
