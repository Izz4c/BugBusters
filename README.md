# PixCII 🎯

## Basic Details

### Project Description

PixCII is a C++ / OpenCV project that transforms video frames into **animated, colored ASCII art** and plays them directly in your terminal.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

⚠️Imagine this: you’ve just installed a brand-new copy of any OS.
It’s shiny. It’s clean. It has… absolutely no media players installed.
You double-click your favorite video —OS stares back at you, helpless.

Installing VLC? Takes too long.
Opening a browser to stream it? Ugh, that’s work.
What if… you could watch the video instantly, right in your terminal?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

💡 Enter  — the world’s most unnecessary yet oddly satisfying answer.
All you need is a terminal, a C++ compiler, and OpenCV.
No clunky video players, no bloated UI — just pure ASCII characters rendering your video in real time, colors included.

Because when life gives you pixels, turn them into text.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- **Languages used:**  
  ✅ C++
- **Frameworks used:**  
  ✅ None (pure C++)
- **Libraries used:**  
  ✅ OpenCV – video handling, frame resizing, and pixel extraction    
- **Tools used:**     
  ✅ ffplay - for audio    
  ✅ g++ – compiling    
	✅ Terminal that supports color.    
  ✅ Sample video files (MP4, AVI, etc.).
   
For Hardware:

- **Main components:**  
  ✅ Any computer capable of running C++ and OpenCV
- **Specifications:**  
  ✅ Minimum: Dual-core CPU, 4 GB RAM  
  ✅ Recommended: Quad-core CPU, 8 GB RAM for smoother playback.      

# Installation

Install **OpenCV** and **g++** for your OS

```g++ main.cpp -o pixcii `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4` ```
